    ├── __init__.py
    ├── __manifest__.py
    ├── controllers
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   └── controllers.py
    ├── demo
    │   └── demo.xml
    ├── models
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   └── models.py
    ├── security
    │   └── ir.model.access.csv
    └── views
        ├── templates.xml
        └── views.xml
